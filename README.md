# Ping Pong
------------------------------------

#### By: *Kassidy Malone-Douglas*

## Description

Ping Pong is my sample JavaScript application, which demonstrates basic proficiency in HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, Git, Markdown, and BDD.

A user can enter a number, and my application will create a list counting upwards from 1 to the user input, with a few exceptions:
* Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
* Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
* Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "pingpong"

## Installation

If you wish to run this application, please clone the repository from this site:
